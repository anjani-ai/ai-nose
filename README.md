# Connected Artificial Nose 🌐👃  

An innovative IoT-enabled system that uses gas sensors and AI to detect and classify odors for industrial safety, environmental monitoring, and more. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware sensors, cloud connectivity, and machine learning to build a digital olfactory system.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Gas Detection**: Monitors environmental gases using advanced sensors.  
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Utilizes machine learning models to identify and classify different odors.  
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Sends sensor data to a cloud platform for analysis and visualization.  
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifies users of detected hazardous gases or abnormal patterns.  
- **Customizable Models**: Train your own machine learning models for specific applications.  

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements  
1. **Microcontroller**: ESP32 or similar with Wi-Fi capability.  
2. **Gas Sensors**: MQ-series sensors (e.g., MQ-2, MQ-135) or other compatible gas sensors.  
3. **Power Supply**: 3.3V/5V as required by the sensors and microcontroller.  
4. **Additional Components**:  
   - Breadboard and jumper wires.  
   - Resistors and capacitors as needed for the circuit.  

## 🧑‍💻 Software Requirements  
1. **Arduino IDE**: For programming the ESP32 microcontroller.  
2. **Python**: For data processing and machine learning model training.  
3. **Cloud Platform**: MQTT broker (e.g., Eclipse Mosquitto) or cloud IoT platform (e.g., AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub).  
4. **Libraries**:  
   - Arduino: `WiFi.h`, `PubSubClient.h`  
   - Python: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
